<Tip>The `studio` application runs on port 3005.</Tip>

`zopio` includes [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio/), which is a visual editor for your database. To start it, run the following command:

```sh Terminal
pnpm dev --filter studio
```

<Note>
  If you have an issue with Prisma Studio, firstly check your Prisma Schema and .env file for the correct database URL and make sure it's running. See /packages/database for more details.
