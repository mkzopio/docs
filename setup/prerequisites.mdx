## Operating System

`zopio` is designed to work on macOS, Linux and Windows. While `zopio` itself is platform-agnostic, the tooling and dependencies we use have different requirements.

## Package Manager

`zopio` defaults to using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager, but you can use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/) instead by passing a flag during the [installation](/setup/installation) step.

We use the Stripe CLI to forward [payments webhooks](/packages/payments#webhooks) to your local machine.
